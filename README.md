I've taken [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializationgs/deep-learning).  I think it's a great place to get started with deep learning.  But, not to undersell it, you get more than just a basic start.  By the end of the convolutional neural network course you're applying YOLO for image labelling (and you know how it works).  And by the end of the
